        Hello everyone! I'm <b>Abdur Rahman Akbar</b> from Peshawar, Pakistan.
        Currently, I'm immersed in the world of web development, focusing on
        learning TypeScript and Next.js. To grasp Next.js effectively, I believe
        it's crucial to have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS. At 17 years
        old, I have ambitious plans to delve into data science once I gain some
        practical experience and earn income through web development work.
